        <p> I enjoyed everything! I just want to say that, in addition to an awesome meal, we had an excelent waitress. She was friendly and efficient. She recognized that we wanted time to visit and did not rush us. She and other staff members made certain that we had everything we needed.</p>

        <p>We had lunch here a few times whilevisiting family and friends. The staff here are just wonderful. We sat on the tables front the patio and enjoyed the view with our delicious Matcha Latte and Strawberry Spinach Salad. Must try!</p>

        <p>I was expecting the food here to follow in the old tradition but was pleased to find the menus trending in a contemporary direction with emphasis on lean, fresh and organic. My favorite dish, in fact, was the Triple Threat Lasagna and Creamy Miso Tofu Soup.<br>
		The chef and his staff are staunch advocates of the farm-to-table concept, sourcing produce, from local organic farms.</p>

        <p>Lovely lunch today. Ordered the Sweet Potato Black Bean Salad and was pleased by the quality, as well as the nicely toasted roll, thick slices of ripe avocado. The side of fresh fruit was also generous and perfectly ripe. A very good experience!</p>
